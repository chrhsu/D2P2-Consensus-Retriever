# CAN-Disorder-Protein-Retriever

CAN (or Core And Noncore) Protein Retriever is a fast way to query and retrieve D2P2 disordered protein consensus data. It utilizes UniProt Accession IDs to query the D2P2 database. 

We define "Core" as proteins that exist in the same subcellular location, and the proteins must be homologous between the eight model organisms (human, cow, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm, yeast, and frog). "NonCore" is defined as proteins that also exist in the same subcellular location as the "Core" proteins, but not all of the proteins exist or are homologous between the eight model organisms. [Add example here]
